Need to build simple web based application. Very limited functionality - basic input and reporting. Host will be Mac OS X/Apache. FileMaker Pro preferred. Open to alternatives if necessary such as: PHP, Ruby On Rails, MySQL. 

Experience with medical projects and privacy/HIPPA compliance a plus. This is a simple database for a medical practice which tracks the insurance authorization process as well as integrates some of the patient's demographics into other customized forms involved in the revenue cycle of the patient. This is a work flow solution that needs to be shared among independent practices locations. Also a Google Docs type of solution may be able to be used too. Please leave your contact information as well as a resume and someone will contact you to discuss this further.

Looking for someone who can help to structure and implement a database solution. I have thought through a lot of the workflow, and hashed out a lot of the required tables. Need someone to go through it with me, fix any logic holes, and implement in a timely manner. Please reply with experience, rate, and availability. I'm cautious about running up a huge bill and that's definitely not what I want, so once we've done our consult and figured out the scope of works, it will be a case of working out more of a fixed price for the job.

Look forward to hearing from you!"

Greetings!

I have a Filemaker pro database that I am using for a billing project. I'm trying to use repeating fields for itemized entries for parts of the work completed. My issue is that I have setup the fields for repeats - but I cannot seem to get the relationship to work properly upon data entry after the first item entered.

There are two tables setup and two layouts . Should be pretty self - explanatory.

Need some help."
