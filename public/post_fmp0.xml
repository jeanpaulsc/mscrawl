Need to build simple web based application. Very limited functionality - basic input and reporting. Host will be Mac OS X/Apache. FileMaker Pro preferred. Open to alternatives if necessary such as: PHP, Ruby On Rails, MySQL. 

Experience with medical projects and privacy/HIPPA compliance a plus. This is a simple database for a medical practice which tracks the insurance authorization process as well as integrates some of the patient's demographics into other customized forms involved in the revenue cycle of the patient. This is a work flow solution that needs to be shared among independent practices locations. Also a Google Docs type of solution may be able to be used too. Please leave your contact information as well as a resume and someone will contact you to discuss this further.

We have a filemaker pro v.7 database that we use for our small transportation company.

We'd like to hire someone to add functionality, improve usability, and develop a web component. 

Please have direct experience with Filemaker Pro, and be located in the Metro NY area, so that you can come to our office for installation, training, etc...

We're a small, but growing business.  We'll probably have more work on an ongoing basis as our business grows, and our industry needs change.  

Please include some information about relevant projects that you've completed in your email.

Greetings!

I have a Filemaker pro database that I am using for a billing project. I'm trying to use repeating fields for itemized entries for parts of the work completed. My issue is that I have setup the fields for repeats - but I cannot seem to get the relationship to work properly upon data entry after the first item entered.

There are two tables setup and two layouts . Should be pretty self - explanatory.

Need some help.</DATA></COL></ROW>
